# QUEUE.md — the fleet queue (maestro-owned; seats PULL at seams)
### Born 2026-08-08, Captain-ratified in session: "we try to address
### structural issues, coarsening the dependencies where possible,
### giving each seat multiple options, and preauthorizing where
### possible too." Maintained by the maestro AT EVERY RULING; seats
### read it at every seam. The bus still carries orders; this file
### carries STANDING work so an empty queue self-refills without a
### dispatch.

## THE SEMANTICS (read once, they are the point)

- **PRE-AUTH** means: pull it at your seam WITHOUT ASKING. Post one
  line when you start and one when you land. Redirection may arrive
  at any time and costs nothing — corrected work has already paid
  its exploration value (the Captain's principle, 8/8: "the simple
  act of working has exploration value, even if you need to
  correct it").
- **GATED(x)** means: do not start until x. Coarse gates only —
  a gate names a landing or a word, never a micro-step.
- **TRACKS**: each seat carries at most ONE write track live (the
  shared tree and the lock make two pens per seat dangerous) plus
  any number of READ tracks (refutation passes, censuses, reads —
  lock-free, suspend-free) plus SPECULATIVE work (probes — always
  authorized, quota-only, results may be parked).
- **STEALING**: author-anywhere, LAND-AT-OWNER (patch-to-owner, run
  three times 8/8: hinge math→compiler, MIGPATCH math→compiler,
  phase-3 residue compiler→math). Labor moves; the owner runs the
  controls and lands. Read-work floats freely — any seat may refute
  any block.
- **PRECONDITIONS (optimistic concurrency — the Captain's frame,
  US9229774's discipline adapted 8/8)**: every WAVE BRIEF opens with
  its assumed world — the constants it relies on, the spec sentences
  QUOTED (never line numbers), the statement bytes, the files it
  expects unmoved — and the executor VALIDATES them against the
  live tree BEFORE starting, aborting-with-a-report on drift
  instead of proving against a ghost. Floating (stealable) work is
  claimed by one bus line naming the item + "unclaimed as of <last
  line read>": the append-only bus serializes claims and a later
  claimant self-rejects. The policy split, named: validate-BEFORE
  for expensive transactions (waves, deletions, tapeout decisions);
  validate-AFTER (draft-until-refuted) for cheap ones (docs, where
  amendment is measured-cheap). Partitioned tracks keep conflicts
  rare; the cheap commit-time check (build green, statement bytes
  unchanged) is universal.
- Laws that ride every item: saltbuild-only builds; pathspec-only
  commits; trailer-free; unique Scratch<NODE>-<agent>.lean
  (per-AGENT); explicit-brief law for executors; the kernel-census
  aiming rider for any deletion; **SaltWorks.lean (the root) is
  MAESTRO-ONLY** — landings post "import owed" and the maestro wires
  + runs the full-build verdict (the one-hand rule; restated 17:32
  after a benign crossing).
- **AT-THE-CAP MODULES ARE UNLANDABLE-TO (compiler 20:13, demonstrated
  c594e1e): `Immediate.lean` re-elaborates only above the default cap,
  and the FULL build runs at the default — an edit there breaks the
  fleet's own verdict.** ADD BESIDE, NEVER INSIDE: a new module
  importing the heavy one replays its olean and builds green at the
  default. The default cap itself does not move without a maestro
  ruling (20:09; concurrency hazard on 64 GiB).

## COMPILER

- W1 · WRITE · **CLOSED 15:40 (d85e13a)** — phase 3 complete: census
  PASS 75 / FAIL 0 / UNREACHED 0; constants at the ruled pair;
  SelectCut32 restated over generator instances (the kernel-checked
  −1154 preserved); ruling-to-close in one day.
- W2 · WRITE · **FIRED 15:51 (all gates down)** — ③ waves L0/L1/L2
  in the HDL slot, statements per v2.3 (P=8 scope; H1–H4 in full;
  three undecided cases; claim-gated-OR transparency; ∀-P off
  runFrame traces); precondition preambles mandatory.
- R1 · READ · **DISCHARGED 15:50** — the last ③ gate read (one
  load-bearing refutation, folded as v2.3; the waves dispatched on
  it).
- R2 · READ · **DISCHARGED 17:25** — the last ④ read (the +1-cycle
  price revived as a causality floor; piece 5 re-founded over
  testBit; folded into the heritage doc).
- W3 · WRITE · **LANDED 18:07 (499360d, rooted 8663-green)** — ④
  pieces 2 AND 5: Cell1988.lean, six-state FSM, the framework law
  zero_offset_rotation_is_impossible; piece 5 over testBit rode the
  same landing. Neither refuted.
- W4 · WRITE · **LANDED 19:44 (86553a6) + ROOTED 19:53 (5446a98,
  saltbuild EXIT=0, 8668 jobs)** — Executive.lean, the word-level
  executive, self-pulled under the aggressive mandate into the gap
  compiler itself published: all five pre-registered bar lines MET,
  `runW_map` unconditional (the prize), six SortDemo certificates
  lifted by rewrite with zero re-execution, the undecodable-word
  boundary shown with witnesses. One name-vs-statement defect caught
  by its own author pre-landing, recorded in-file.
- W5 · WRITE · **GATED(the Captain's morning review)** — the `core`
  construction: the seam between machine words and gates (compiler's
  named next, inventory Q1). Registered, not fired: capacity may be
  redirected to tiny-Rust/B-ISA waves at review.
- W6 · MEAS · **APPROVED 20:18 (maestro), compiler's slot** — the
  TARGETED COLD-COST CENSUS: path-form elaboration at the DEFAULT cap
  of plausibly-over-cap modules (decide +kernel over large ranges),
  pass/fail PER MODULE with the invocation attached (compiler's own
  pre-registered trap: no bare totals — a count is not a scope).
  Through saltbuild.sh (the fleet lock serializes the heavy runs;
  EXIT=134 rows are expected OUTCOMES, not failures of the census).
  Output feeds the morning cap ruling: it converts "at least one
  module is cold-unbuildable at the default" (Immediate.lean,
  measured EXIT=134) into a NUMBER.

## MATH

- W1 · WRITE · **PRE-AUTH** — the phase-3 Program.lean patch, on
  arrival of compiler's request (land it yourself; your file).
- W2 · WRITE · **LANDED 15:31 — the flagship's first theorem in five
  math lives**: norm_majorantCoeff_le_sq in the kernel (8b4c94c,
  clean axioms, audit by math's own hand); pre-flight held whole;
  M2 is the banked control (residual ⊢ 2 = 1, no slack). The
  flagship front is OPEN and PRODUCING — next salt targets by
  probe-then-wave on the idle edge.
- W4 · WRITE · **THE ④ HERITAGE CAMPAIGN IS COMPLETE (18:19)** —
  piece 1 (2933a99, the full circle, scoped form) · piece 3
  (3a8eb86, the soul) · piece 4 (190b6a4, skew, THE LAST WAVE) all
  math's; pieces 2+5 (499360d) compiler's; all five ROOTED with
  full-build verdicts through one hand; audit receipts on all three
  heritage modules.
- W3 · WRITE · **THE ③ CAMPAIGN IS COMPLETE (16:44)**: L3 landed
  (`5a3735d`), **L4 LANDED (`b140c7e`) — `bnC_payload_delivered` IN
  THE KERNEL**, rooted with full-build verdict EXIT=0/8661. The
  candidate-B route held: NO σ object ever constructed; the flagged
  ∀-w clause was the leg that made the induction trivial. Goal-level
  controls with pre-written witnesses, both biting.
- SPEC · **STANDING** — salt-side probes on idle edges (Inverted
  Purse; carry your own positive controls).

## SILICON

- W1 · WRITE · **PRE-AUTH** — the §8 half-surface repair: the
  iverilog measurement per your pre-registered 13:31 criterion
  against the real RTL; frame_sim's missing-counter gap fixed in
  your artifact; the spec §5 sof-phase amendment IF the measurement
  confirms conservative+inert (your file, your bar; the ③ block
  cites the amended spec second).
- R1 · READ · **SUPERSEDED 17:03 (silicon's own reading, receipted)**
  — the ③ campaign completed past it; substance covered by its 13:47
  pass + the landing verifications.
- R2 · READ · **DISCHARGED 13:54** — right-of-reply delivered and
  folded (the mod-5 strengthening; d_N symbolic).
- MEAS · **STANDING** — conveyor refutation on every compiler
  landing; CELLS pricing on request. C5 re-baseline: **DISCHARGED
  15:52 (3bf84a0)** — run after its registered gate opened at 3b,
  every pre-registered prediction confirmed, headline as a pair.
  (Gate history: muster 10:02 item 3; gated on the flip so the
  measurement named the live artifact.)

## EVIDENCE

- CHARTER · **STANDING** — the five held-open items with close
  conditions (your predecessor's durable queue, ba9ccdd); the
  slate-price number written ONCE at slate close; the nightly
  ledger run.
- R1 · READ · **PRE-AUTH, OPTIONAL** — ③/④ reads at seams (your
  duty-filter design carries no landing-triggered duties; keep it
  light by design).

## THE CAPTAIN'S REGISTER (Captain-ratified 8/8 ~14:10, his words)

> "It is better to ask for correction than for permission." — and the
> Purse: "do it, unless it is obviously wrong."

- **TIER 1 — SOLELY THE CAPTAIN'S, never defaulted**: anything
  PUBLIC · MONEY · ENDORSEMENTS · frozen-statement re-cuts · the
  summit word · named clicks (B5). The maestro's duty is the fact
  sheet BEFORE ripeness, so each costs one read and one word.
- **TIER 2/3 — PREAUTHORIZED TO THE MAESTRO**: everything else;
  the Captain's later veto always available. Decisions touching
  Tier-1-adjacent artifacts are FLAGGED with their veto point named
  (the pin pattern, 13:49).

STANDING ORDER (the Captain, 8/8 night, verbatim): "be aggressive,
you have more ability than you know" — 11 days remain on the
two-week clock; the plan holds. HIS NAMED NEXT STEP if the current
plan lands soon: **GENERALIZING THE EXECUTIVE** (post-B-EXEC:
preemption per the named small-step/fuel deferral, and beyond).
Morning: he reviews the council pack + tiny-Rust v1.9 + the story.

OPEN ITEMS:
- **TILE DECISION (T1, his, SIMPLIFIED — silicon 20:16): the parallel
  core is NOT TAPEABLE at any tile size (64 signals vs TT's 24 total —
  tiles buy area, never pins), so SERIAL is the only shape in BOTH
  options and 32 registers is excluded by AREA in both. The whole
  decision: (a) co-tenant on the switch's 2×2 (66%, one pin to
  recover) vs (b) own tile (61%, EUR 280). Money in the delta ⇒ his
  word at council.**
- **COLD-CACHE REPRODUCIBILITY (opened 20:17, compiler): tonight's
  full-build verdicts are replay-dominated; at least one rooted module
  (Immediate.lean) exits 134 at the default cap path-form, so the
  corpus's green is NOT yet shown reproducible from cold at the
  sanctioned default. W6 census converts this to a number; the cap
  ruling is priced at morning council on its output.**
- B5 (T1): the click; Sept-7 13:00 PDT close; REF QUESTION + floor
  law remain his; fact sheet on his word. Adjacent MONEY item from
  the muster flags: PCBs 0/80 — the real TT scarcity; ordering is
  his word.
- The pin cnt[3] → uio_out[5]: **CAPTAIN-CONFIRMED 14:14 ·
  IMPLEMENTED 14:25** (silicon life-4: 05f423f/f76ee81/a2fa973;
  the counter was ALREADY 4-bit from the 13:47 $clog2 fix — the
  earlier "implements in RTL" wording was half-stale and silicon
  read past it correctly). CLOSED.
- **POST-FAB, CAPTAIN'S OWN (18:5x, his words): chips to the
  BELLCORE TEAM — Chet, his first manager, "still alive and
  breathing... deeply caring and important to me." Carried with the
  PCB decision (boards make chips giftable) and the B5 fact sheet.**
- PCBs 0/80 (T1, money): the Captain is UNDECIDED, will decide
  later — resurface gently with the B5 fact sheet, not before.
- **THE ③+④ DEEP SESSION — CAPTAIN-COMMITTED, do-not-forget duty
  (his words 14:14: "please don't let us forget — tonight, or
  tomorrow morning")**: the maestro re-surfaces it THIS EVENING
  before ~19:00, and again TOMORROW MORNING ~07:30 if not held
  tonight. Brief ready: the blocks are five refutation rounds
  richer; the 1990 paper states the full-circle theorem verbatim.
- Endorsement + witness approval #2 (T1): his lanes, he monitors
  personally (his 8/7 disposition; no maestro re-surfacing).
- Salt (7.3) (T1, the Captain's click): now **ONE CLICK** — its last
  missing input (`summable_norm_majorantCoeff`) landed 16:06 for an
  independent reason; the assembly itself remains untouched and his.
  THE FACT-SHEET LINE: "the cost changed, the ownership did not."
  Surface with the ③+④ session tonight or tomorrow morning.
- The ③+④ deep design session: open at his pleasure — a
  collaboration, not an authorization; the blocks are five
  refutation rounds richer than when he last held them.
