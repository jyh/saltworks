"""No infrastructure name (a host, an account) may sit in the public tree.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The private-paths gate (check_private_paths.py) fires on PATHS into the private
record. The 2026-09-02 refuter pass on the v1 flip package found 41 occurrences of
a class no gate covered: the name of the machine the episodes ran on and the name
of the subscription account that ran them, in frozen documents, evidence READMEs
and harness defaults. They were replaced by role words ("the Studio", "the bench
account", the ssh alias `studio`) and the class is GATED here, so that it is held
by an instrument rather than remembered.

WHAT IT CHECKS
--------------
Every tracked, text file, case-insensitively, for the forbidden names. The names
are ASSEMBLED in this file rather than spelled, for the same reason the trailer
gate assembles its fixture: this gate scans itself.

FAILING CLOSED
--------------
A scan over zero files REDS. `--self-test` proves the empty scan is fatal, that a
planted name is caught in every case and prefix form, and that the role words pass,
before the tree scan is trusted.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
-------------------
It does not scan commit MESSAGES. History carried one such message at the time this
gate was written; whether that history is rewritten before the flip is the owner's
decision (PUBLISH-CHECKLIST.md), and a gate that reds on a decision not yet taken is
a gate that gets abandoned.

PORTED TO salt 2026-10-07 BY THE HELM (154th head) UNDER COUNCIL 2026-10-07 RULING 3, his words "ratchet only is
fine": salt's tree carries infrastructure names today (26 lines in 6 files at the port, all documentation and
Lean comments), so here the TREE ARM IS A RATCHET -- it accepts the residue listed in
scripts/infra_names_baseline.tsv (file, line-sha16; never the text, never the name) and REDS on anything NEW.
The push arm (--range) accepts an added line only when it is byte-identical to a baselined line in the same file
(a verbatim move); an EDITED line that still carries a name is NEW, and the remedy is to drop the name from the
line, not to grow the baseline. saltbench's copy (the source of this port) has a clean tree and reds on any hit;
the two files are otherwise kept the same so a fix in one ports to the other.

THE PATH ARM AND THE DIGEST FILE COLUMN (2026-10-07, found porting this gate to a fourth repo)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two defects lived in this script, not in any one repo, and both were measured on a port that failed:
  1. THE BASELINE LEAKED. Its file column was a clear PATH, so a repo whose tracked paths carry a declared name
     wrote those names into its own baseline files -- and the port's own commit was then refused by --tree,
     --history and the hook, while PR CI scans a synthetic merge sha that no history row can name.
  2. THE GATE WAS PATH-BLIND. It read file CONTENTS and never file NAMES, so a new file named for a host
     passed every arm in every repo.
THE FILE COLUMN, both baselines: a clear path OR `sha256:<first 16 hex of sha256(path bytes)>`; the reader takes
either. The WRITER emits the digest exactly when the path itself carries a declared name, and the clear path
otherwise -- so a baseline written for a repo with no such path is byte-identical to the format before this
change, and a baseline written for any repo carries no declared name at all.
THE PATH ARM: --range and --history read the paths a range or commit ADDS or RENAMES TO (`git diff
--name-status`, the same base the line arm uses); --tree reads every tracked path. A path finding is accepted
only by a PATH ROW, keyed by the path's digest and marked `PATH` where a line row carries a number or a line
digest -- tree `sha256:<16><TAB>PATH<TAB><what>`, history `<sha><TAB>sha256:<16><TAB>PATH` -- so a path row
and a line row can never accept each other's finding. Every finding names a name-bearing file by its digest, never in clear.
To find the file a digest names, hash the tracked paths LOCALLY; never paste the answer into a public surface.

EXIT CODES (2026-10-07: until this section existed, a range git could not read was a GREEN)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  0  clean: every population the arm was asked to read was read, and nothing NEW was found.
  1  a finding, or a refusal BY NAME: a NEW name, a tree baseline that is missing, a SHALLOW clone under
     --history, an empty scan, a forbidden set smaller than declared, or --history with --range.
  2  usage: argparse refused the command line.
  3  GIT COULD NOT READ what the arm was asked to scan: a range end that does not resolve (a missing sha, an
     empty side, a three-dot range, a FILE name), an object the repository does not hold, or a directory that
     is not a repository. NOTHING was scanned, and the run never prints OK.
WHY 3 EXISTS: the line arm and the path arm read git's stdout and never its exit status, so `--range
<unresolvable sha>..HEAD` read git's EMPTY stdout as "nothing added" and printed OK with rc 0, and so did a
commit whose blob is missing under --history (which then WROTE a shorter baseline). Every git call this gate
makes now checks git's exit status. --range also RESOLVES both ends before it diffs, and every diff ends its
revisions with `--`: without both, a range whose two ends name tracked files diffs the WORKING TREE and exits 0,
and outside a repository git compares the two FILES and exits 0. git's own message is withheld (it can name a
path, and a CI log is public): rerun the named git command locally to read it.

#   FOUR accounts across FOUR boxes, and a BOX NAME (2 files) and an ACCOUNT NAME (2 files) were sitting
#   on PUBLIC main with Scrub GREEN. The gate was never wrong; it was OUTGROWN, and nothing announced
#   that.  ⇒ 🔑 AN ARM THAT NAMES ONE MEMBER OF A SET GOES VACUOUS WHEN THE SET GROWS.
FORBIDDEN = [
    "kri" + "ter" + "ion",      # a box, and an account: the original single stem

]

# ⛔ THE ONE THAT CANNOT BE A BARE SUBSTRING, AND THE REASON IS NOT A TECHNICALITY.
#   One account's name is the Captain's own GIVEN NAME, which appears legitimately in this public
#   repo as AUTHORSHIP -- `CITATION.cff` and `paper/saltbench-v1.tex` (\author{...}, and twice in the
#   bibliography). A bare substring rule would RED the paper's author line, and a gate that reds on
#   correct content is a gate that gets deleted. So that account is gated in its CONFIG-DIR SHAPE
#   only, which no byline can produce.
#   ⇒ 🔑 A NAME THAT IS ALSO A PERSON'S NAME IS GATEABLE ONLY IN THE SHAPES INFRASTRUCTURE USES.
#   ⇒ Anything this shape cannot catch is carried by the CONVENTION instead: a public tree names
#     accounts by anonymised label (ACCOUNT A / ACCOUNT B), with the mapping in the private record.

# ⛔ WHAT THIS TRIPWIRE DOES AND -- MORE IMPORTANTLY -- WHAT IT DOES NOT.
#   It refuses to scan when the forbidden set has SHRUNK below the count declared here. That catches
#   a name being DELETED. It does NOT catch the failure that actually happened, which was the FLEET
#   GROWING while this list stood still: both lines below are edited by the same hand, so they move
#   together and neither can notice a new account or a new box existing.
#   ⇒ 🔑 A DECLARATION AND THE THING IT DESCRIBES, EDITED TOGETHER, CANNOT CHECK EACH OTHER.
#   ⇒ **Completeness is not checkable from inside this repo at all.** The roster lives outside it and
#     MOVES, and CI cannot read it. Only a FLEET-SIDE check that reads the roster can know this set is
#     incomplete; that check is the load-bearing one and this is a second lock, not the lock.
#     (Named by `systems` on the bus, 2026-09-10, correcting this seat's first claim for it.)
#   The count is printed on every run so a reader can compare it against the fleet map rather than

# THE RECONCILIATION ITSELF, WRITTEN OUT, so a reader can check COMPLETENESS without re-deriving it.
# The roster carries 6 ACCOUNTS and 4 BOXES -- 10 entities, covered by the 10 stems above because two

#   report lands in a world-readable Actions log. ⇒ 🔑 THE MECHANISM BUILT TO STOP A PRIVATE STRING
#   ENTERING THE RECORD PUBLISHED A SAMPLE OF EXACTLY WHAT IT CAUGHT.
#
#   ⭐ DRIVEN BEFORE THE CHANGE, ON A SCRATCH REPO: a planted line printed the account name, the home
#   path AND an unrelated marker that happened to share the line. **The leak is not bounded by the
#   name it matched** — it is the whole line, to 160 characters.
#
#   ⭐ MEASURED AT THE FORGE, the reason this was not hypothetical: across 92 failed Scrub runs on the
#   five gated public repos, 25 carried a gate FAIL block, and the home-directory / host / account
#   classes appear in saltbench runs ONLY — because this file is the only UNTRUNCATED echoer and it
#   runs in this repo alone (404 in salt, saltworks, jas, x86lean).

# ⛔⛔ THE HISTORY AND RANGE ARMS, ADDED 2026-09-11.
# Measured that night, on the helm's ruling about the SIBLING gate: this file
# had `[-h] [--self-test]` and nothing else. No range arm, no history arm, no
# message arm. It scanned the tracked TREE and had never read a single commit —
# and it is the gate on HOST AND ACCOUNT NAMES, the class the fleet has an
# explicit law about and the one that actually leaked.
#   ⇒ Measured over saltbench's 360 commits the first time this ran:
#       current tree   0 occurrences        ✅
#       history      107 occurrences in 36 commits, NONE of them still in the tree
#   ⇒ 🔑 A GATE WITH ONE ARM IS CLEAN ABOUT THE ONLY POPULATION IT CAN SEE, and
#     the tree is the population that MOVES. Everything it ever caught and
#     everything anyone ever tidied away is still in a public clone.
#
# ⛔ THE RATCHET IS NOT A REPAIR AND MUST NOT READ AS ONE. A pushed commit's
# content cannot be changed without a force-push, ruled out 08/30 and in any
# case a Captain-level call on a public repo an arXiv paper now cites. This
# freezes the population and COUNTS it. It stops tomorrow's commit and says
# nothing whatever about yesterday's.
